1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
From my youthful times, from my youthful times

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:12,970
do I hear a song so dear.

3
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:20,510
How remote the times, how remote the times

4
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:27,410
that were once so near!

5
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:34,900
What the swallow sang, what the swallow sang,

6
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:41,660
heralds fall and spring,

7
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:49,350
along the village, along the village,

8
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:58,030
it is still heard?

9
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:05,790
When I left from there, When I left from there,

10
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:12,720
trunk and coffer were heavy.

11
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:20,800
When I came back, when I came back,

12
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:29,130
all was empty.

13
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:43,350
No swallow brings, no swallow brings

14
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:52,150
back to you, what you are longing for.

15
00:01:52,620 --> 00:02:00,870
but the swallow sings, but the swallow sings

16
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:08,620
in the village as before.

17
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:17,650
From my youthful times, from my youthful times

18
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:24,920
do I hear a song so dear

19
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:33,960
How remote the times, how remote the times

20
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:46,850
that were once so near!
